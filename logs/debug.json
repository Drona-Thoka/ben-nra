Sometimes the voices talk about me, and it\u2019s really unsettling.\n\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that you're going through a difficult time after your loss. To better understand how you're feeling and how I can help, could you tell me more about your mood and emotions since the bereavement? For example, have you been feeling persistently sad, numb, or experiencing mood swings?\n\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling really overwhelmed and sometimes numb, but other times I get really anxious or scared, especially when I hear the voices.

I want to help you as best as I can. Can you tell me how your mood has been lately, and if you've noticed any changes in your sleep, appetite, or energy levels since your bereavement?\n\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I\u2019ve been feeling really down and tired, and it\u2019s hard to focus on anything. My sleep has been pretty bad, and I don\u2019t feel like eating much lately.\n\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that you've recently experienced a loss. I understand this can be a very difficult time. To help me understand how you're feeling and how best to support you, could you tell me more about your mood and daily functioning since the bereavement? For example, have you noticed changes in your sleep, appetite, energy levels, or interest in activities you used to enjoy?\n\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I haven\u2019t really felt like doing much lately, and it\u2019s hard to focus on anything. My sleep has been off, and I don\u2019t really feel hungry most of the time.\n\nDoctor: I'm sorry for your loss. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling emotionally and physically since your bereavement? For example, have you noticed changes in your sleep, appetite, energy levels, or ability to concentrate?\n\nSpecialist (Psychiatrist): I have reviewed the patient's case notes. Please share your thoughts to begin the consultation.\n\nDoctor: Thank you for reviewing the case. Here are my observations and initial thoughts: **Summary of Findings:** - The patient is a bereaved adult following the recent death of their father. - Since the bereavement, they report: - Auditory hallucinations: hearing voices that comment on them, sometimes giving commands or saying upsetting things. - Intrusive, uncontrollable thoughts. - Marked difficulty with concentration. - Emotional symptoms: persistent low mood, anhedonia, anxiety, emotional numbness, and mood lability. - Neurovegetative symptoms: poor sleep, reduced appetite, low energy. - No prior psychiatric history is documented. **Differential Diagnoses:** 1. **Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features:** - The patient meets criteria for a major depressive episode (low mood, anhedonia, sleep/appetite disturbance, poor concentration, low energy). - Presence of auditory hallucinations suggests psychotic features. - The psych\n\nSpecialist (Psychiatrist): Thank you for the detailed summary. I agree that Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features is a leading diagnosis, but it is also important to rule out bereavement-related psychosis, brief psychotic disorder, and the possibility of an emerging primary psychotic disorder. Could you clarify the content of the hallucinations (e.g., are they related to the deceased), the presence of any suicidal ideation or risk, and whether there is any substance use or medical comorbidity? Immediate safety assessment is warranted given the psychotic symptoms.\n\nDoctor: Thank you for your input and for highlighting the need for a thorough risk and diagnostic assessment. Based on my initial evaluation, here are some clarifications and additional considerations: **1. Hallucination Content:** From the patient\u2019s description, the voices are not specifically identified as the deceased father\u2019s, nor do they appear to be comforting or related to the bereavement itself. Instead, the voices are described as talking about the patient in the third person, sometimes giving commands or making upsetting comments. This content seems more consistent with psychotic depression or a primary psychotic disorder, rather than typical grief-related phenomena (such as hearing the voice of the deceased in a comforting way). **2. Suicidal Ideation and Risk:** I have not yet directly assessed for suicidal ideation, intent, or self-harm. Given the presence of psychotic symptoms and significant depressive features, I agree that an urgent safety assessment is necessary. I will ask the patient specifically about any thoughts of self-h\n\nSpecialist (Psychiatrist): Thank you for the update. I strongly recommend an immediate, direct assessment of suicidal ideation, intent, and risk, including any command hallucinations related to self-harm or harm to others. If there is any evidence of acute risk or inability to ensure safety, urgent psychiatric intervention and possible hospitalization should be considered. Please also clarify any history of substance use, recent medical illnesses, or cognitive changes to further refine the differential.\n\nDoctor: Thank you for your guidance. I agree that immediate risk assessment is paramount, especially given the presence of psychotic symptoms in the context of significant mood disturbance. **To refine the differential and ensure a comprehensive evaluation, I propose the following next steps and considerations:** **1. Risk Assessment:** - I will conduct a direct and thorough assessment of suicidal ideation, including: - Any current or past thoughts of self-harm or suicide. - Presence of intent or plans. - Whether the voices are issuing any commands related to self-harm or harm to others. - Assessment for homicidal ideation or risk to others. - Ability to maintain safety at home and presence of social supports. **2. Substance Use:** - I will inquire specifically about recent or past use of alcohol, cannabis, stimulants, hallucinogens, or other substances that could precipitate or exacerbate psychotic symptoms. **3. Medical and Cognitive Assessment:** - I will review for\n\nSpecialist (Psychiatrist): Your proposed approach is excellent and comprehensive. Once risk and substance use are assessed, please also screen for delirium or other acute medical causes (e.g., infection, metabolic derangement), and consider baseline labs (CBC, electrolytes, LFTs, TSH, B12, folate). If psychotic depression is confirmed and risk is high, urgent psychiatric referral and consideration of antipsychotic plus antidepressant therapy\u2014or ECT if severe\u2014are indicated.\n\nDoctor: Thank you for your guidance and for emphasizing the importance of a broad medical and psychiatric assessment. **To further refine the diagnosis and ensure a safe, holistic approach, I would like to clarify and discuss the following points:** ### 1. Medical Workup and Delirium Screening - I agree that delirium and acute medical causes must be ruled out, especially given the new-onset psychotic symptoms. I will perform a focused neurological exam and screen for signs of infection, metabolic derangement, or other acute illnesses. - I will order baseline labs as suggested (CBC, electrolytes, renal and liver function, TSH, B12, folate, glucose, and urinalysis), and consider a urine drug screen to rule out substance-induced psychosis. - If there are any abnormal findings or cognitive fluctuations, I will consider further imaging (e.g., CT/MRI brain) or additional investigations. ### 2. Psychiatric Risk Assessment - I will conduct a direct assessment of\n\nSpecialist (Psychiatrist): Your plan is thorough and appropriate. Please ensure the psychiatric risk assessment includes evaluation for catatonia, agitation, and capacity for self-care, as these may also necessitate urgent intervention. Once risk and medical causes are addressed, we can proceed with a definitive psychiatric diagnosis and initiate targeted treatment.\n\nDoctor: Thank you for your feedback and for highlighting the importance of assessing for catatonia, agitation, and self-care capacity. I will ensure these are included in my evaluation. To further refine our approach, I would like to clarify a few points and seek your input: 1. **Catatonia and Agitation:** - I will assess for signs of catatonia (e.g., mutism, stupor, posturing, waxy flexibility, echolalia/echopraxia) and agitation (restlessness, pacing, inability to remain still). - If catatonic features are present, would you recommend a lorazepam challenge as an initial step, or should we proceed directly to psychiatric admission? 2. **Capacity for Self-Care:** - I will evaluate the patient\u2019s ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs), maintain personal hygiene, and adhere to medication or treatment recommendations. - If there is significant impairment, do you feel this alone\n\nDoctor: Hello, I\u2019m Dr. Agent. I understand you\u2019ve recently experienced a loss, and I\u2019m here to support you. To help me understand how you\u2019re feeling and how best to assist you, could you tell me a bit about your relationship with the person you lost and how their passing has affected you emotionally and in your daily life?\n\nPatient: My dad and I were really close, and losing him has been really hard. Since he passed, I feel like my mind is racing and I can\u2019t focus on anything. I also keep hearing voices that aren\u2019t really there, and it\u2019s making me feel scared and confused.\n\nDoctor: Hello, I\u2019m Dr. Agent.

I understand you\u2019ve recently experienced a loss, and I\u2019m here to support you. To help me understand how you\u2019re coping, could you tell me how your mood has been since the bereavement? Have you noticed any changes in your sleep, appetite, or daily functioning?\n\nPatient: It\u2019s been really hard since my dad passed away. I haven\u2019t been sleeping well, and I find it difficult to focus on anything. My appetite isn\u2019t great either\u2014I just don\u2019t feel hungry most of the time.\n\nDoctor: I'm sorry for your loss. Losing someone important can be incredibly difficult. Can you tell me how your mood has been since the bereavement, and if you've noticed any changes in your sleep, appetite, or energy levels?\n\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I\u2019ve been feeling really down and tired, and it\u2019s hard to focus on anything. My sleep has been pretty bad, and I don\u2019t feel like eating much lately.\n\nDoctor: Thank you for coming in today. I understand you've recently experienced a loss, and that can be incredibly difficult. Could you tell me how your mood and daily functioning have been affected since your bereavement?\n\nPatient: It\u2019s been really hard to focus on anything, and I feel like I\u2019m not myself. I keep hearing voices that aren\u2019t there, and it\u2019s making it difficult to get through the day.\n\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that you\u2019ve experienced a recent loss. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Can you tell me how your mood and daily functioning have been affected since the bereavement? For example, have you noticed changes in your sleep, appetite, energy, or ability to enjoy things you used to?\n\nSpecialist (Neuropsychiatrist): I have reviewed the patient's case notes. Please share your thoughts to begin the consultation.\n\nDoctor: Thank you for joining this case, and for reviewing the notes. I appreciate your neuropsychiatric perspective, as this is a complex presentation. **Summary of Key Findings:** - Adult patient, no prior psychiatric history documented. - Recent bereavement (death of father), with close relationship. - Since bereavement: persistent low mood, anhedonia, poor sleep and appetite, low energy, impaired concentration. - Prominent psychotic symptoms: auditory hallucinations (voices talking about the patient, sometimes giving commands or making upsetting comments), intrusive uncontrollable thoughts, anxiety, emotional numbness, mood lability. - No clear evidence that hallucinations are comforting or directly related to the deceased. - No documentation yet of substance use, acute medical illness, or cognitive fluctuations. - No direct assessment yet of suicidal ideation, command hallucinations, or risk to self/others. **Differential Diagnosis:** 1. **Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features** (psychotic depression\n\nSpecialist (Neuropsychiatrist): Thank you for the summary. I agree that major depressive disorder with psychotic features is high on the differential, but it is essential to urgently assess for suicidal ideation, the nature of command hallucinations, and risk to self/others. Please clarify if there is any history of substance use, recent medical illness, or cognitive changes, and consider basic labs and neuroimaging to rule out organic causes if indicated.\n\nDoctor: Thank you for your input and for emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive risk and organic workup. I agree that the presence of psychotic symptoms in the context of recent bereavement and depressive features warrants urgent and thorough assessment. **To refine the diagnosis and management plan, I propose the following:** ### 1. Immediate Risk Assessment - I will conduct a direct and detailed assessment of suicidal ideation, including: - Any current or past thoughts of self-harm or suicide. - Presence of intent, plans, or preparatory behaviors. - Whether the voices are issuing any command hallucinations related to self-harm or harm to others. - Assessment for homicidal ideation or risk to others. - Ability to maintain safety at home and presence of social supports. - I will also assess for agitation, catatonia, and capacity for self-care, as these may necessitate urgent intervention or hospitalization. ### 2. Substance Use and Medical History - I will\n\nSpecialist (Neuropsychiatrist): Your plan is appropriate and thorough. In addition, please screen for recent cognitive changes (e.g., confusion, memory impairment) and perform a brief neurological exam to rule out delirium or other organic causes. If risk is high or organic etiology is suspected, urgent psychiatric and medical admission should be considered.\n\nDoctor: Thank you for your guidance and for emphasizing the importance of screening for cognitive changes and performing a neurological exam. I agree that, given the acute onset of psychotic symptoms in the context of bereavement and mood disturbance, it is critical to rule out organic causes, including delirium, especially in the absence of prior psychiatric history. To further refine our diagnostic approach, I would like to clarify and discuss the following points with you: **1. Cognitive and Neurological Assessment** - I will conduct a brief cognitive screen (e.g., orientation, attention, memory, language, executive function) to assess for any evidence of delirium or other cognitive impairment. - I will perform a focused neurological examination to look for focal deficits, signs of increased intracranial pressure, or other neurological abnormalities. - If there are any abnormalities or if the history suggests waxing and waning mental status, I will prioritize neuroimaging (CT/MRI) and further medical workup. **2. Organic/Medical Differential\n\nSpecialist (Neuropsychiatrist): Your approach is sound. In addition to neuroimaging if indicated, I recommend basic labs (CBC, electrolytes, LFTs, renal function, thyroid panel, B12/folate, syphilis/HIV serology if risk factors) to screen for metabolic, infectious, or endocrine contributors. Please also clarify any recent medication changes, toxin exposures, or family history of psychiatric/neurological illness.\n\nDoctor: Thank you for your detailed recommendations and for highlighting the importance of a broad organic workup. I agree that, given the acute onset of psychotic symptoms in the context of bereavement and mood disturbance, it is essential to rule out medical, metabolic, and toxic causes, especially in the absence of prior psychiatric history. **To further refine our diagnostic process, I would like to clarify and discuss the following:** ### 1. Additional History - **Medication and Toxin Exposure:** I will specifically inquire about any recent medication changes (including over-the-counter, herbal, or illicit substances), as well as possible exposures to toxins or new supplements. - **Family History:** I will ask about any family history of psychiatric disorders (e.g., mood disorders, psychosis, bipolar disorder) or neurological illnesses (e.g., dementia, epilepsy) that might increase vulnerability. - **Medical History:** I will review for any recent infections, head trauma, or systemic illnesses that could present with neuropsychi\n\nSpecialist (Neuropsychiatrist): Your plan is comprehensive and appropriate. Once you have gathered this additional history, please update me on any positive findings, as these may shift the differential toward a primary psychiatric versus organic etiology. If all organic causes are excluded and risk is manageable, we can proceed with a working diagnosis of major depressive disorder with psychotic features and discuss initiation of antidepressant plus antipsychotic therapy or ECT if indicated.\n\nDoctor: Thank you for your guidance and for confirming the next steps. I will proceed with the detailed assessment as outlined. To further refine our diagnostic process and ensure we are not missing any organic contributors, I would like to clarify a few points and seek your input on management nuances: **1. Cognitive and Neurological Assessment** - I will perform a brief cognitive screen (orientation, attention, memory, executive function) and a focused neurological exam. - If there is any evidence of cognitive fluctuation, focal deficits, or delirium, I will prioritize urgent neuroimaging and medical admission. **2. Medical and Substance History** - I will inquire specifically about: - Recent medication changes (including OTC, herbal, or illicit substances) - Possible toxin exposures - Recent infections, head trauma, or systemic illnesses - Family history of psychiatric or neurological disorders **3. Laboratory and Imaging Workup** - I will order CBC, electrolytes, renal and liver function, TSH,\n\n",
