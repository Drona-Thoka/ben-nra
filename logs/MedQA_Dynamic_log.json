Systemic Features:** - I will specifically ask about constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats) to assess for systemic involvement. - I will inquire about fatigue, which is common in many rheumatologic conditions. **3.

Clinical Red Flags for PID:** - In your experience, are there particular infection patterns (e.g., early-onset, severe, or unusual organisms) or associated autoimmune features (cytopenias, enteropathy, granulomatous disease) that should prompt expedited genetic testing, even before full immunologic workup is complete? - Are there specific warning signs (e.g., failure to thrive, persistent lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly) that you find particularly predictive of PID in adults? **2.

I fully agree that the combination of early-onset, severe, or unusual infections, multilineage cytopenias, organomegaly, and a suggestive family history are highly predictive of an underlying primary immunodeficiency (PID), even in adults. To further refine our diagnostic approach, I would like to discuss and clarify the following points: **1. Approach to Cytopenias in Suspected PID:** - In cases where persistent or recurrent cytopenias are present (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or anemia), do you recommend initial evaluation for immune-mediated mechanisms (e.g., direct antiglobulin test, anti-neutrophil/platelet antibodies), or do you prioritize bone marrow evaluation early, especially if there is associated organomegaly or abnormal peripheral smear findings? - Are there particular patterns of cytopenia (",
