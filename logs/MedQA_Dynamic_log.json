A few points and questions for further discussion: 1. **Flow Cytometry Details:** - The preliminary flow cytometry also shows strong CD34 expression and absence of surface IgM, with no aberrant myeloid or T-lineage markers. Would you consider this profile consistent with \u201ccommon\u201d B-ALL, and are there any additional markers you recommend to further refine the diagnosis (e.g., CD20, CD22, CD58, or aberrant expression patterns)? 2. **Cytogenetic/Molecular Testing:** - While we await the FISH and molecular results, are there any particular cytogenetic abnormalities you would prioritize",

For further refinement, I recommend assessing CD20, CD22, CD58, and CD38, as well as checking for aberrant expression of myeloid antigens (CD13, CD33) or T-lineage markers (CD7, CD5), even if preliminary results are negative. For cytogenetics, prioritize ETV6-RUNX1 (t(12;21)), BCR-ABL1 (t(9;22)), hyperdiploidy, hypodiploidy, and KMT2A (MLL) rearrangements, as these have major prognostic and therapeutic implications."

A few follow-up points and questions for your expertise: **1. Aberrant Antigen Expression:** - If we detect low-level expression of myeloid markers (e.g., CD13 or CD33) on a subset of blasts, but the overall profile remains strongly B-lineage, would you consider this as aberrant expression without changing the diagnosis, or would it prompt consideration of mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL)? - Are there specific thresholds or patterns (e.g., co-expression with MPO) that would push you toward an MPAL diagnosis? **2. CD20 Expression:** - If CD20 is positive, would you recommend incorporating rituximab into the treatment protocol, even in standard-risk patients, or do you reserve this for high-risk or relapsed cases? **3.

Low-level CD13 or CD33 expression on B-lineage blasts is common and considered aberrant antigen expression; diagnosis remains B-ALL unless there is strong co-expression of myeloid markers (especially MPO) or clear evidence of dual lineage per WHO criteria, which would suggest MPAL. 2. CD20 positivity (\u226520% blasts) may support adding rituximab, particularly in high-risk or CD20-high cases, but its use in standard-risk pediatric B-ALL is still debated and should be individualized per protocol and multidisciplinary discussion. 3.
